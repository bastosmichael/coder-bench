You are a senior TypeScript engineer.

Implement a generic LRU cache in TypeScript inside the file `src/lruCache.ts`.

Requirements:
- Pure TypeScript, ES2020
- No usage of `any`
- LRU eviction must be O(1)
- Optional TTL that lazily purges expired entries
- Output must be a *single* fenced ```ts code block containing only the full file contents.
